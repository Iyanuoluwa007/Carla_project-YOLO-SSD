## üîç Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking in CARLA using YOLO, ByteTrack & StrongSORT

This project demonstrates a CNN-based robotic vision system built in the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/), integrating **YOLO** for object detection with **ByteTrack** and **StrongSORT** for robust multi-object tracking. The system enables mobile robots to perceive dynamic environments in real-time, supporting applications in autonomous navigation and intelligent traffic monitoring.

### üõ† Simulation Environment: CARLA

- High-fidelity urban simulation with dynamic traffic, pedestrians, and variable weather.
- RGB, Depth, and Semantic Segmentation cameras were attached to the vehicle via Python API.
- Simulated camera footage was used to generate training and inference datasets for deep learning.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Object Detection: YOLO

- [YOLOv11n](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/#models) was trained using the **BDD100K** dataset and CARLA-generated images.
- Detection classes included: `car`, `bus`, `truck`, `bike`, `person`, `traffic light`, etc.
- Achieved **mAP@0.5 = 0.444**, with high precision for frequent classes like `car` and `bus`.
- Real-time performance suitable for mobile and embedded applications.

### üéØ Object Tracking: ByteTrack & StrongSORT

**ByteTrack**:
- Tracking-by-detection algorithm using IoU matching + Kalman Filter.
- Incorporates low-confidence detections for better robustness.
- Pros: Fast (~6.3 FPS), low ID switches, lightweight.
- Ideal for resource-constrained systems needing real-time tracking.

**StrongSORT**:
- Enhanced DeepSORT with deep Re-ID features for robust identity matching.
- Combines appearance embeddings with motion cues.
- Pros: High MOTA/MOTP, excellent occlusion handling, better in crowded scenes.
- Trade-off: More computationally intensive (~3.8 FPS).
